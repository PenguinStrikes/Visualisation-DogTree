Breeds that form unique clades supported by 100% of bootstraps are combined into triangles. For all other branches, a gold star indicates 90% or better, black star 70%−89%, and silver star 50%−69% bootstrap support. Breeds are listed on the perimeter of the circle. A small number of dogs do not cluster with the rest of their breed, indicated as follows: ∗cane paratore, +Peruvian hairless dog, #sloughi, @country-of-origin salukis, and ˆminiature xoloitzcuintle.
